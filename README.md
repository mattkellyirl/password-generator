# Javascript Password Generator: Matt Kelly

This password generator is a web based application, built with Javascript. To use this application, users must choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Once the password length is determined users must choose whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters. At least 1 character type must be chosen for the password to be generated. 

User preferences are collected by using browser window prompts. When users are prompted with a character type, they must choose "OK" to include or "Cancel" to not include that specific character type in the password.
